This is my implementation of Lab3 for oop with Java\
Run DataAnalysis.java for the GUI portion\
Run DataAnalysisConsole.Java for the console portion\ 
\

If you have trouble running it, right click on the src dir and click 'Mark Directory As' and then source. I had to do this when I pulled a fresh copy.
